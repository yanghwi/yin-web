excerpt: "How automation compresses the lifespan of taste and why slow communities matter."
---

We write at a moment when the life of a reference can be measured in weeks. The
machines learn the pattern before we even name it, and in doing so they render
it ordinary. A cultural half-life is the time it takes for an idea to lose half
its strange energy; lately, that half-life feels like a free fall.

Yet the shrinking window between spark and saturation does not have to end in a
flattened horizon. We can practice a more deliberate pace—slowing the intake,
resisting the autoplay, building small rooms where context matters.

The essay is a sketch of such rooms. It is an invitation to design for delay and
to rediscover the pleasure of waiting for taste to evolve in human time.
